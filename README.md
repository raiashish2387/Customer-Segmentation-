# Customer-Segmentation-
Data Analysis on Customer Segmentation for a Telecommunication Company

In this case study, we will analyze data from a subscription-based service that offers various plans to customers. The company maintains two tables: **`customers`** and **`payments`**. The **`customers`** table stores customer information, such as customer ID, customer name, email address, and service type. The **`payments`** table records payment transactions made by customers, including the payment ID, customer ID, payment amount, and payment date.

My objective is to gain insights into customer payment behavior and identify patterns that can help improve customer retention and revenue. By applying SQL concepts learned in Day 2, we will perform analysis tasks such as calculating total payment amounts, identifying customers who have made recent payments, segmenting customers based on payment history, and more.

Throughout the case study, we will utilize advanced filtering techniques, string functions, date/time functions, numeric functions, and subqueries to extract and analyze the data effectively. This will provide valuable insights into customer payment behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making for the subscription service company.
